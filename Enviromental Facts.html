                        <li>Every day, around 27,000 trees are sacrificed solely to make toilet paper.</li>
                        <li>Every minute, 100 acres of rainforest are bulldozed.</li>
                        <li>Beef is one of the most major contributor to deforestation.</li>
                        <li>Only 1% of all available water is often used by humans.</li>
                        <li>7.5 million tons of oil are dumped in the seas.</li>
                        <li>8.78% of marine animals are at risk of choking due to plastic.</li>
                        <li>Every year, plastic kills over a million marine creatures.</li>
                        <li>Burps and farts from cows are bad for the environment.</li>
                        <li>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.</li>
                        <li>The amount of wood and paper thrown out each year could heat 50 million houses.</li>
                        <li>The age of the planet is estimated to be around 1 million years.</li>
                        <li>Fungi are extremely important in the ecosystem. </li>

                        <li>The amount of water on Earth is constant, and it is recycled constantly.
                            There's a good possibility that some of the water you drink has gone through the intestines of a
                            dinosaur.

                        <li>Between 1970 and 2015, human use of Earth's natural resources more than quadrupled.
                            From 2015 to 2050, our usage of natural resources is anticipated to increase by more than
                            double.

                        </li>
                        <li>NASA estimates that if present deforestation rates continue, the world's rainforests will

                        <li>Aluminum is a material that may be recycled indefinitely. One pound of aluminum
                            recycled can save enough energy to power our televisions for at least three hours.
                            Humans consume 80 trillion aluminum cans each year.</li>
